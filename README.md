**ABOUT ME** <br>
"My strong passion for the Internet, computers, and gaming led me to enroll in a Fullstack Web Developer bootcamp with EPICODE, which I started in October 2023. Although the bootcamp is finished, I am dedicated to learning and reinforcing the concepts I've mastered over the course duration. For the next few months and beyond, I plan to consolidate my knowledge by continuing to build projects and explore new technologies in the field."
